# Welcome to HoneyDB Agent Docs!

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/honeypy/badge/?version=latest)](http://honeydb-agent-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**honeydb-agent**

The HoneyDB agent can implement numerous network service emulations (plugins). The level of interaction is determined by the functionality of the plugins. All activity is logged to a file by default, but the primary purpose for the honeydb-agent is to contribute the log data back to the [HoneyDB website](http://honeydb.io).

From the HoneyDB website your logs are accessible via a REST API.

- Configure logging to HoneyDB
- Configure honeydb-agent services.
